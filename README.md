[Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) is a open-source tool to generate static sites for content-driven products. It covers documentation, blogs, product landing, market page, etc.

Trough easy-to-use CLI it generates a React project, which allows a lot of customization and create all the necessary stuff for a performant and SEO friendly website.

The content is powered by [Markdown JSX (MDX)](https://mdxjs.com/) which makes really easy to write and maintain documentations and blogs posts.
