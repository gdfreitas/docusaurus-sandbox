[Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) is a open-source tool to generate static sites for content-driven products. It covers documentation, blogs, product landing, market page, etc.

Trough easy-to-use CLI it generates a React project, which allows a lot of customization and create all the necessary stuff for a performant and SEO friendly website.

The content is powered by [Markdown JSX (MDX)](https://mdxjs.com/) which makes really easy to write and maintain documentations and blogs posts.

## Example

Checkout the folder [my-website](./my-website) which has a generated Docusaurus project.

- [**/docs**](./my-website/docs) has all the docs
- [**/sidebars.js**](./my-website/sidebars.js) links available docs
- [**/blog**](./my-website/blog) has all the blog posts
- [**README.md**](./my-website/README.md) has all the setup information for local development
